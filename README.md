# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification 🌿  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Iris Flower Classification** project is a **machine learning** application that aims to classify different species of the **Iris flower** based on their petal and sepal dimensions. This is a **supervised learning** problem where the goal is to train a model to predict the **species** of a flower given four numerical measurements:  

- **Sepal Length (cm)**  
- **Sepal Width (cm)**  
- **Petal Length (cm)**  
- **Petal Width (cm)**  

This project utilizes the **Iris dataset**, a well-known dataset in machine learning, to develop a classification model. The dataset contains **150 samples**, equally distributed among three species:  
✅ **Iris-setosa**  
✅ **Iris-versicolor**  
✅ **Iris-virginica**  

By applying **machine learning algorithms**, we can accurately classify an Iris flower based on its measurements.

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview  
The dataset consists of **150 records** with the following **6 columns**:  

| Column Name       | Description | Data Type |
|-------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Id**           | Unique identifier (not needed for training) | Integer |
| **SepalLengthCm** | Length of the sepal | Float |
| **SepalWidthCm**  | Width of the sepal | Float |
| **PetalLengthCm** | Length of the petal | Float |
| **PetalWidthCm**  | Width of the petal | Float |
| **Species**       | Type of Iris flower (Target Variable) | Categorical (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) |

✅ **No missing values**  
✅ **Well-balanced dataset** (each species has 50 samples)

## 🔍 Project Workflow  
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
- Load the dataset using **pandas**  
- Drop unnecessary columns (e.g., `Id`)  
- Encode the **categorical target variable** (Species) into numerical labels  
- Split the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** subsets  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊  
- Visualizing **feature distributions** using **histograms, box plots, and scatter plots**  
- Checking for **correlations** between features  
- Plotting **pairwise relationships** to understand class separability  

### 3️⃣ Model Training 🤖  
We train a **classification model** to predict the **species of a flower** based on its features. The following steps are performed:  
- Use **scikit-learn** to train a **classification model**  
- Evaluate model performance using:  
  ✅ **Accuracy score**  
  ✅ **Confusion matrix**  
  ✅ **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**  

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation 📈  
- Test the trained model on the **test dataset**  
- Analyze **misclassifications** and accuracy metrics  
- Compare different algorithms (e.g., **Decision Trees, SVM, KNN**)
